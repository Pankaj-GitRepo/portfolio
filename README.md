## Work Experience

### HSBC, ML/NLP | Senior Data Scientist & ML/NLP Engineer
#### _Jun 2023 – Till Date | Hyderabad, IN_

- Performed data cleaning, features scaling, and feature engineering using Pandas &
NumPy packages in Python and ensured data quality, integrity & consistency.
- Performed preliminary data analysis using descriptive statistics and handled anomalies.
- Designed rich data visualizations to model data into a human-readable form & graphs
using Python data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and Tableau.
- Hands-on experience in various machine learning algorithms and statistical algorithms
like decision trees, text analytics, Natural Language Processing(NLP), supervised &
unsupervised, regression models, social network analysis, neural networks, deep
learning, SVM, clustering to identify volumes using Scikit-Learn package in Python.
- Developed NLP models for topic extraction, sentiment analysis and text classification.

### CAPGEMINI, MVP ARCHITECTURE & MIGRATION | Data Engineer
#### _Jan 2022 – Jun 2023 | Bhubaneswar, IN_
  
- DevOps CI/CD pipeline integrated with serverless AWS Lambda
– Built DevOps CI/CD pipeline using AWS (serverless Lambda, S3, Cloudwatch, SQS),
GitHub (Code repository), Jenkins (for Automated Continuous Integration and
Orchestration), UDeploy (for Continuous Deployment), Snowflake (for data storage
through a Snowpipe) integrated with Splunk ( Search Processing Language for
monitoring, searching & to generate alert and email notifications).
– Hands-on experience in Python, JSON Validator, SQL queries, Bash & Shell scripting.
  
- SAS to Python-Pyspark Migration
– Developed and optimized Pyspark codes and automated them in the EMR cluster.
– Migrated terabytes of on-prem data into cloud (Snowflake, & AWS S3) & also
migrated SAS codes into Pyspark & Python with 100% accuracy, thereby saving
nearly $800M of the client per year.
– Designed project flows and built AI & ML data pipelines using visual and code recipes
in the Dataiku DSS (Data Science Studio).
– Led multiple LOBs and mentored at least 10 junior developers & honed their skills.

### CAPGEMINI, PRICE PREDICTION ML MODEL | Data Scientist
#### _Oct 2020 – Dec 2021 | Bangalore, IN_
  
- Scraped, cleaned, and assimilated AirBNB hotels & customers data as inputs for building
an ML model to predict the price of any Airbnb hotel.
- Performed extensive EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) on the input data. Analyzed and
investigated them using their summary statistics.
- Applied Clustering and dimension reduction techniques, which helped in creating
graphical displays of high-dimensional data containing many variables.
- Visualized univariate and multivariate clusters of water usage, price, income, and other
factors in the US using Jenks and K-Means algorithms.
- Converted categorical values that affect hotel price into their corresponding numeric
forms using Label Encoding and One Hot Encoding techniques.
- Built a prediction model i.e., an explanatory linear regression model to predict the price
of hotels based on city, location,room type, and many otherfactors.
- Trained and tested the model by splitting our data into 80:20 ratio and by implementing
CV(Cross-Validation) such as K-fold cross-validation technique on it.
- Improved R2-score of the prediction model by applying various supervised regression
algorithms such as linear, polynomial, decision tree, random forest, Gradient Boosting,
Lasso & Ridge, etc. while making sure that our model is not over-fitting the training data.
